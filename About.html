            <p class="lead">NCBV currently is run by two coaches: Kris Back and Kevin Brown who both have coached for several years and played for many more years. Both coaches have dedicated a lot of their time to make this unique beach volleyball club in North Central Florida. The club's goal is to make sure the players have fun, compete, learn the game of beach volleyball, and improve their game in an encouraging, safe environment. In addition, NCBV will try to help any players interested in playing at the next level obtain a beach volleyball scholarship through training, working hard, giving honest opinions of players to college coaches or recruiters, and making sure the players are recognized in tournaments.

            <p class="lead">Coach Kris began his athletic career at the young age of four with little league T-ball. After playing baseball, soccer, basketball, football, and hockey, he began playing volleyball in 2002 for Miami Southridge Senior High. Initially, volleyball was challenging, especially hand setting, because of his disability; but, with good technical coaching and thousands of repetitions he became proficient in all aspects of the game by the time he graduated in 2005. Upon arrival at the University of Florida Kris began playing with the UF Club indoor volleyball team and with local professional beach players that frequently played on the UF sand courts. After graduating from UF in 2009 Coach Kris continued to work for the university as a personal trainer and for local volleyball clubs and public schools before purchasing a house with his wife near North Marion High School. Coach Kris enjoys training daily and playing beach volleyball a few times a week at his home court in Citra. Besides coaching juniors, Coach Kris is also training with Coach Kevin Brown and the two will be competing at professional level circuits this season.</p>

            <p class="lead">Coach Kevin began playing beach volleyball after graduating high school at the age of 18. Prior to volleyball Coach Kevin played baseball and soccer. The game grew on him quickly and after a few years began to start training hard and playing open level tournaments. He enjoys spending most of his weekends competing on the beach against other high-level players and loves the atmosphere; from the early morning drives to playing the final games as the sun sets. Kevin has been coaching players for three years now that range from 8 to 50 years old. Coach Kevin will be playing in professional tournaments hoping to qualify this year with Coach Kris.</p>
